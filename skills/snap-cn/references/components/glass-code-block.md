# glass-code-block

**Tier:** `snapcn` (animation) · **Vibe:** tech · **Natural length:** 180f @ 30fps

A premium frosted-glass code editor window with a regex tokenizer and line-by-line stagger reveal. Lines fade and slide in sequentially against a translucent dark panel with traffic-light chrome, making it suitable as a hero background or feature highlight.

shadcn add @snapcn/glass-code-block

## Use when

- A landing or hero scene needs an animated code backdrop that reads as "premium dev tool."
- You want to showcase a code snippet with a styled editor chrome and no interactive narrative.
- The backdrop must stay transparent so the panel composites over a custom background.

## Don't use when

- The scene requires the code to be visibly typed out character by character — use `terminal-simulator` or `typewriter` instead.
