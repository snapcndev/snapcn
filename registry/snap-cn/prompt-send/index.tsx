// --- Main composition ------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * A prompt composer that unrolls from a hairline, writes a brief into itself
 * while the camera rides the caret, then cuts back out and gets sent.
 *
 * ## Four things were measured, and they are the component
 *
 * **The unroll.** It does not fade in and it does not scale up from nothing. A
 * 2px white line appears at the panel's top edge and the box grows *downward*
 * out of it — top edge pinned, bottom edge travelling its full height in 445ms —
 * while the width goes from 0.93 to 1. The writing surface and the chip strip
 * are two separate heights on the same curve with different durations, which is
 * why the strip surfaces from under the field late rather than being there from
 * the first frame.
 *
 * **The typing is eased.** 17 chars/sec on the first word, 33 in the middle, and
 * a visible settle on the last three. An ease-in-out sine over the character
 * count fits all 69 of the reference's to within 0.30 characters rms; no
 * constant rate is close.
 *
 * **The camera cuts, and then it rides.** 2.327× in a single frame, landing with
 * the caret 57% across the frame, then tracking left with the sentence — pinned
 * to the *continuous* typing curve, so the caret wobbles ±8px about its mark as
 * each character jumps ahead of the slide. Then it cuts again, out to 1.44×,
 * centred on the send button, which is where the pointer is already heading.
 *
 * **The pointer is a real mouse.** It enters the bottom-right corner and its
 * distance to the button halves every 44ms — an exponential approach, not a
 * constant glide. It is drawn outside the camera because a pointer belongs to
 * the screen, not to the scene, and must not grow when the shot pushes in.
 *
 * ## Nothing here is a constant tuned to one sentence
 *
 * Every offset above is either a fixed inset or a ratio of a font size, and
 * `layoutFor` turns four numbers — `width`, `fieldHeight`, `fontSize`,
 * `chipFontSize` — into the whole geometry. Longer copy scrolls the field under
 * the caret instead of running past its edge; more chips wrap and the panel
 * grows by exactly the rows they needed; no chips at all and it hugs the field.
 * Both camera marks are fractions of the frame, so a wider panel reframes rather
 * than drifting off it.
 *
 * ## What is not measured
 *
 * The colours and the wording. The reference is a specific product with a
 * specific blue; none of that belongs in a component that ships to strangers and
 * lands next to somebody else's `Input` (design-system rule 5). The paint is the
 * shadcn token set, the field takes its surface from the `Input` primitive's own
 * style context so the two cannot drift, the wash is layered from `accentColor`
 * (`theme.primary` by default), and every string is a prop.
