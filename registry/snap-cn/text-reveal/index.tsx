   * steps: during the slow ends of an eased curve the baseline drifts a fraction

   * whole pixel at once. Pivoting the scale *on the baseline* means the baseline's
   * device Y never changes, so there is nothing to snap.
   *
   * **The shake.** Hinting distorts each glyph's outline so its stems land on
   * whole pixels. As the size slides, every stem re-snaps to a different grid and
   * the letterforms visibly change shape frame to frame — they boil.
   * `text-rendering: geometricPrecision` turns hinting off and renders the outline
   * as it actually is.
