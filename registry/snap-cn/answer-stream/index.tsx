 * The symmetry is the measurement, not a default. Tracking the column's two

 * centre, which is a cubic in-out and *not* a spring (a spring peaks at a

 * curves start together, end together, and part by at most **0.048 of scale**
 * around the midpoint — the reference is fractionally front-loaded against a
 * symmetric cubic. A quadratic in-out closes about a third of that. It is not
 * worth a second easing curve: the residual is one frame of timing in the
 * middle of a 33-frame move, and `easings.inOut` is the one the rest of the
 * registry already moves on.
 *
 * `1` is where the shot **settles**, not where the pull-back bottoms out. That
 * distinction is worth a sentence because getting it wrong is silent: normalise

// --- Main composition ------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * The beat after you press send: the macro shot on the button, the **cut**, and
 * the answer building itself on the page while the camera pulls back to keep up
 * with it.
 *
 * ## Scene to scene, the frame cuts. It never transitions.
 *
 * Read frame by frame, the reference has exactly one grammar for changing
 * shot, and it is a hard cut — one frame wide, no blur, no ramp. What makes the
 * cuts invisible is not a transition, it is what happens **either side** of
 * them:
 *
 * - **Every cut lands on motion.** The camera here is 8 frames into an
 *   accelerating push toward the button when the cut fires. It is moving fastest
 *   at the moment it is replaced, which is the oldest trick there is for hiding
 *   an edit.
 * - **Every cut is followed by a glide, not a stop.** The frame arrives slightly
 *   off and eases in — measured, the answer page lands 27px high and settles
 *   down over 15 frames on an ease-out. Cut to a static frame and the edit is
 *   the loudest thing in the shot.
 *
 * The only *move* in the whole reference is inside a shot, and there are two
 * kinds: a slow idle drift that never stops, and one fast blurred push to
 * whatever is about to happen.
 *
 * ## The pull-back is fitted to the content, not to the clock
 *
 * As the answer grows — paragraph, then headline, then four cards, then the
 * composer sliding up — the camera pulls back and rises to keep the block in
 * frame. Tracking the column's left and right edges across the move recovers a
 * scale of **1.404× → 1.0** about a fixed point at **(0.5, −0.548)** of the
 * frame: dead centre horizontally, and 273px *above the top edge*. Both edges
 * agree on that point to within 1px, which is what makes it a measurement and
 * not a guess. A focal point above the frame is the whole reason the page
 * appears to rise as it shrinks, instead of collapsing toward its middle.
 *
 * Peak velocity sits at 48–52% of the move, so the curve is a cubic in-out —
 * see `shotBScale`. And the move carries **motion blur** at its fastest frames,
 * derived from the camera's own speed rather than dialled in by eye.
 *
 * ## Containers land empty; content streams into them
 *
 * The pill, and every card, arrive as an empty surface first and fill after.
 * The text itself arrives a word at a time, each word **hot** — at the accent —
 * cooling to `foreground` on a fixed clock, which keeps a moving band of about
 * six words lit at the head of the stream.
 *
 * ## What is not measured
 *
 * The colours and the copy. The reference is a specific product with its own
 * coral, its own four icon tints and its own marketing lines. None of that
 * belongs in a component that lands next to somebody else's `Input`
 * (design-system rule 5). The paint is the shadcn token set, the composer takes
 * its surface from the `Input` primitive's own style context, and every string
 * is a prop.
