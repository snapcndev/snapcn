/**
 * The type faces a scene's `fontFamily` may name.
 *
 * ## Why an allowlist and not a free string
 *
 * Every component in this registry loads its face through
 * `@remotion/google-fonts` rather than a CSS variable, for the reason spelled
 * out at the top of each one: a Remotion bundle has none of the app's CSS, so
 * `var(--font-…)` gets you the right face in the Player and a **fallback in the
 * mp4**. A bare family name handed to a component has exactly the same problem
 * — the browser preview finds it, the render does not, and the bug is invisible
 * until someone plays the file.
 *
 * So a name only counts as a font here if this module has loaded it. Values map
 * label → the real CSS family string `loadFont` returns, which is not always the
 * label ("Instrument Serif", not "InstrumentSerif").
 *
 * ## A raw stack still works
 *
 * `resolveFont` passes anything it does not recognise straight through, so a
 * caller who has loaded their own face — a brand font, a local `@font-face` —
 * names it directly and gets it. The allowlist is the safe path, not the only one.
 *
 * ponytail: all six load at module scope, so a render fetches six latin subsets
 * whether or not the video uses them. Move to a lazy per-family `loadFont()` if
 * bundle time ever shows up in a render trace.
